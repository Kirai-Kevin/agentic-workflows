# RetailX AI Assistant

## Project Overview

RetailX AI Assistant is an intelligent system designed to analyze customer data and answer questions about RetailX's customers, products, and sales. It uses an agentic AI workflow to autonomously handle data retrieval tasks and provide insightful answers to user queries.

The system leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and implements an iterative, multi-step process to ensure accurate and relevant responses. It breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps, allowing for improvements and adaptations throughout the task completion process.

## Features

- Autonomous data analysis and question answering
- Integration with SQLite database for data storage and retrieval
- Use of advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex problem-solving
- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/retailx-ai-assistant.git
   cd retailx-ai-assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API keys:
   - Open `workflow.py`
   - Replace `"YOUR_LLAMA_API_KEY"` with your actual Llama API key
   - Replace `"YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY"` with your actual LangSmith API key

5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python database_setup.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

3. In the text input field, enter your question about RetailX customers, products, or sales.

4. Click the "Submit" button to process your query.

5. The AI Assistant will analyze the question, retrieve relevant data from the database, and provide an answer.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file
- `workflow.py`: Defines the agentic AI workflow and LLM interactions
- `database_setup.py`: Sets up the SQLite database and provides utility functions
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages

## Advanced Usage

The RetailX AI Assistant uses an agentic workflow process that includes:

1. Action Planning: Determines if the question can be answered with available data
2. SQL Query Generation: Creates appropriate SQL queries to retrieve relevant data
3. Query Execution: Runs the generated SQL query on the database
4. Answer Generation: Formulates a human-readable response based on the query results

This multi-step process allows for more accurate and context-aware responses compared to traditional single-step approaches.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all required packages are installed correctly
2. Verify that your API keys are set up properly in `workflow.py`
3. Check that the database has been initialized correctly
4. Make sure you're running the latest version of Python (3.7+)
